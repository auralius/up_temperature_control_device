This is a repository for the Universitas Pertamina's temperature control device.

Visit this page for some projects that can be implemented to the device:   

https://bit.ly/TemperatureControlDevice  


Features:
- Low cost.
- Open hardware and software, you can make your own.
- Excellent linearity at steady state condition when the temperature is below 120 degress of Celcius.
- Two heaters with two temperature sensors.
- Each heater can be heated to about 140 degrees of Celcius.
- The device is designed such that only the power resistors that become hot. The driving transistors barely become hot.


The software that is used is MATLAB Simulink with the Arduino support package. It is also possible to use LabVIEW with Linx libraries for the Arduino.

You might also want to look into the Arduino TCLab from Birgham Young University, where we mainly get our inspiration from: http://apmonitor.com/pdc/index.php/Main/ArduinoTemperatureControl
